# modelling-Earth-s-orbit-using-Python
A Python project that models a 2D trajectory of Earth using Newton's Law of Gravitation. It simulates a planet's orbit by calculating its position at discrete time steps and visualizes the resulting path with Matplotlib. This project demonstrates key principles of Newtonian physics and data visualization.
